Cloud Foundry

Summary
Integrating PaaS solutions within an organization shifts the engineering effort from infrastructure management to product development. Additionally, it provides a powerful developer experience throughout the release process of an application, where the main functionalities are consumed through a UI or console. However, there is one major downside with this offering: vendor and application catalog lock-in. If an application is deployed using a PaaS offering from GCP, the application catalog of external services is narrowed down to GCP services mainly. Consequently, the open-source fundamentals were applied to PaaS offerings, resulting in an open-source PaaS such as Cloud Foundry.

Cloud Foundry is an open-source PaaS, a stand-alone software package that can be installed on any available infrastructure; private, public, or hybrid cloud. Due to its open-source nature, there is no vendor lock-in and the community can contribute to its future releases and definition of the roadmap. As such, Cloud Foundry offers a production-grade release process through a solid developer experience, that enables any application to be deployed with ease.

Note: some offerings of Cloud Foundry, can be deployed on top of Kubernetes, meaning that its main components are running as pods within a cluster.

Cloud Foundry consists of multiple components that provide these core capabilities:

Routing - handle the incoming external traffic and route it to applications
Authentication - identity management to user accounts
Application lifecycle - controls the application deployments, monitors their status, and reconciles any new changes to reach the desired state of the application.
Application storage and execution - handle the availability of artifacts to applications
Service - use service brokers to provisions on-demand the dependency services for an application, such as a database or third-party APIs
Messaging - ensure the communication between Cloud Foundry components
Metrics and logging - aggregates the system and application metrics and logs
In the following sections, we will explore Cloud Foundry using SUSE Cloud Application Platform Developer Sandbox. However, you can explore Cloud Foundry's functionalities using the following offerings as well:

IBM Cloud Foundry
SAP Cloud Platform

Could Foundry Walkthrough - Part 1
Let's explore the release of an application using Cloud Foundry!

Note: The walkthrough demos aim to highlight the simplified developer experience to release an application without the need to manage infrastructure components. Learning and understanding each Cloud Foundry functionality and implementation details is not an objective for this course.

Summary
This demo showcases the main capabilities of the Stratos console and Cloud Foundry.

Some of the noteworthy sections are:

Marketplace and Services - research the service catalog and explore any integrated services
Organizations - used to manage multi-tenancy, quotas, and access to applications
Routes - list all available endpoints used to access deployed applications
Build Packs - explore available buildpacks packages used to build an application
Security groups - configure the endpoints that the application can communicate with
Could Foundry Walkthrough - Part 2
Note: This demo references the Python hello-world application.

Summary
This demo provides a step-by-step guide on how to deploy a simple Python hello-world application to Cloud Foundry.

Noteworthy steps in this demo:

Python hello-world is a simple Flask application, serving on port 8080
Cloud Foundry can use a manifest.yml file to store the configuration of the application, such as name and quotas
Routes are used to access the application and can be configured or created randomly

Exercise: Cloud Foundry
So far, you have been exposed to two ways of deploying an application: using a PaaS solution such as Cloud Foundry and using Kubernetes resources. However, both mechanism allows for a variable level of configuration flexibility and abstractions of infrastructure components.

Imagine the following scenario: you are part of the team that needs to assess the benefits and drawbacks of using Cloud Foundry versus Kubernetes.

Considering that the application code is available, reflect on what operations and steps are necessary to adopt each solution (Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes) for a successful application deployment. What are the main drawbacks of each solution?

Reflect on Cloud Foundry versus Kubernetes adoption - part 2
What are the steps to adopt Cloud Foundry for a successful application deployment?

Your reflection
Kubernetes
create an OCI (Open Container Initiative) compliant image, usually created by using Docker
deploy a Kubernetes cluster with a valid ingress controller for the routing of requests
deploy an observability stack, including logs and metrics
create the YAML manifests for the application deployment
create a CI/CD pipeline to push the Kubernetes resources to the cluster
Things to think about
Go to the solution page.

Reflect on Cloud Foundry versus Kubernetes adoption - part 3
What are the main drawbacks of each solution?

Your reflection
Cloud Foundry
write a manifest file to provide main application deployment parameters
deploy Cloud Foundry or use Cloud Foundry PaaS solutions from 3rd part vendors
deploy the application to Cloud Foundry (via CLI or UI)

Note: Cloud Foundry will create the OCI compliant image by default, and it will provide the routing capacities as well.

Solution: Cloud Foundry
It is pivotal to understand the application functionalities and available resources. This is especially the case when a microservice-based design is chosen, and solutions suck as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service) are available from a multitude of vendors. Choosing the most suitable deployment tooling will lead to the efficient delivery of the product.

Considering that the application code is available, these are the steps to adopt each proposed solution:

Kubernetes
create an OCI (Open Container Initiative) compliant image, usually created by using Docker
deploy a Kubernetes cluster with a valid ingress controller for the routing of requests
deploy an observability stack, including logs and metrics
create the YAML manifests for the application deployment
create a CI/CD pipeline to push the Kubernetes resources to the cluster
Cloud Foundry
write a manifest file to provide main application deployment parameters
deploy Cloud Foundry or use Cloud Foundry PaaS solutions from 3rd part vendors
deploy the application to Cloud Foundry (via CLI or UI)
Note: Cloud Foundry will create the OCI compliant image by default, and it will provide the routing capacities as well.
Cloud Foundry provides a better developer experience for application deployment, as it offers a greater level of component abstraction (no need to manage the underlying infrastructure). However, a PaaS solution locks-in the customer to a specific vendor. On the other side, Kubernetes offers full control over the container orchestration, providing more flexible management of the application.
