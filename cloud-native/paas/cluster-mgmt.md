## Cluster management

## Summary

- Kubernetes offers a wide range of functionalities that form the principles of any modern infrastructure.
- These capabilities revolve around automation, portability, extensibility, flexibility, self-healing, and many more. However, managing Kubernetes at scale is challenging, especially when the clusters are self-hosted in datacenters or private clouds. In this case, a team has to keep up-to-date with the latest Kubernetes releases, to ensure the platform is updated, upgraded, managed, and configured to meet the production-grade standards.

Within any organization, a release process consists of releasing the application to multiple environments, such as sandbox, staging, and production. In this case, each environment is represented by a separate Kubernetes cluster, with a total of 3 clusters. However, the number of clusters grows exponentially if the platform is replicated across different regions. This is usually required to keep market proximity and deliver a service to consumers with minimal latency. As a result, if the infrastructure is distributed across the US, Europe, and the Asia Pacific, a team ends up operating 9 clusters. Configuring, managing, upgrading, updating, and deploying to all of these clusters is a herculean task and often requires a dedicated team.

In these circumstances, if an organization does not have sufficient engineering resources, delegating the platform management to a 3rd party provider is a more suitable solution. This is covered by a PaaS or Platform as a Service solution.
