Welcome to Open Source PaaS lesson!

Throughout the release process, the development team has to collaborate closely with the infrastructure team. This is necessary to ensure that the application requirements can be fulfilled by the platform capabilities. However, this is a use case where an organization has enough resources to hire a development and infrastructure team. Small organizations, consists of small teams that focus fully on application development. In these circumstances, it is only a natural movement to delegate the management of platform components to a 3rd party.

In this lesson, we will explore the Platform as a Service (PaaS) mechanism as a way to deploy a service without underlying infrastructure knowledge.
