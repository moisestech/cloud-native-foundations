### **Summary 1**

- An organization will always explore the most efficient offering to deploy a product to consumers. PaaS solutions are lightweight on initial setup, as a team can release the code in production within days.

- However, there are use cases where customers interact with a service only once a day or for a couple of hours within a day. For example, a service to update a timetable with the new bus schedule once a day. In this case, using a PaaS offering has one major downside: it is not cost-efficient. For example, with Cloud Foundry there will always be an instance of the application up and running, even if the service is used once a day. However, the team is billed for a full day.

- For this scenario, a **FaaS** or **Function as a Service** is a more suitable offering. FaaS is an event-driven cloud-computing service that allows the execution of code without any management of the infrastructure and configuration files. As a result, the timetable update service is invoked only once a day, and for the rest of the time, there are no replicas of this service. A team will be billed only for the time the service is executed.

- Popular FaaS solutions are:

  - [**AWS Lambda**]()
  - [**Azure Functions**]()
  - [**Cloud Functions from GCP**]()
  - and many more.

- Throughout the release process, a FaaS solution only requires the application code that is built and executed immediately.
- In comparison with a PaaS offering, this FaaS has a quicker usability rate, as no data management or configuration files are necessary.

### New Terms

- **FaaS** or **Function as a Service** - event-driven cloud-computing service that requires only the application code to execute successfully.

## Exercise: Function as a Service

- Exercise: Function as a Service
- FaaS (Function as a service) unlocks the ability to solely focus on building an application with no concerns for the underlying infrastructure. However, it is crucial to comprehend its usage within a microservice-based design.

Imagine the following scenario: you are working for a media (newspaper) company and was assigned to develop a microservice responsible for the life-cycle of customer accounts. **The principal operations include account creation and deletion.**

Considering the above, reflect on what mechanisms you would choose to deploy the microservice, PaaS, or FaaS. Elaborate on your reasoning.

**What mechanism would you choose to deploy the customer account management microservice? Explain your reasoning.**

## **Solution: Function as a Service**

For this particular exercise, choosing either a PaaS or FaaS would reach the end goal: making the service available to customers.

In most cases, in a newspaper context, the readers are more focused on the news content rather than managing their accounts. Also, the number of requests to get an article can be a thousandfold higher than the number of requests to create or delete an account. As such, you can assume that the microservice should not be running at all times consuming available resources, and instead invoke it on demand-only.

Conclusively, a FaaS solution would be more suitable for the management of customer account microservice.

## Lesson Conclusion

### Summary 2

Throughout its evolution, an organization needs to periodically evaluate available cloud-computing services, to ensure that the business requirements are always fulfilled. The industry has an abundance of cloud-computing offerings, such as on-premise, IaaS, PaaS, and FaaS, with a rich collection of open-source and vendor managed tools. In this lesson, we analyzed Cloud Foundry, an open-source PaaS, that can be hosted on any available compute and provide a unified and powerful end-user experience. We have also explored, FaaS an event-driven offering, that increases the cost-efficiency of a platform.

Overall, throughout this lesson we explored:

- PaaS Mechanisms
- Cloud Foundry
- Function as a Service

## Glossary

- **On-premise** - cloud-computing service, where a team owns the entire technology stack.
- **IaaS** or **Infrastructure as a Service** - cloud-computing service that offers the abstraction of networking, storage, server, and virtualization layers.
- **PaaS** or **Platform as a Service** - cloud-computing service, where the infrastructure components are managed fully by a 3rd party provider, and a team manages only the application and the data associated with it.
- **Cloud Foundry** - an open-source PaaS offering, that can be hosted on any available infrastructure
- **FaaS** or **Function as a Service** - event-driven cloud-computing service that requires only the application code to execute successfully.
