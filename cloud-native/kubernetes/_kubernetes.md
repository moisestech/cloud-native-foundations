## Kubernetes - The Container Orchestration Framework

Kubernetes - The Container Orchestrator Framework

### Summary

- So far, in this lesson, we have traversed the packaging of an application using Docker and its distribution through DockerHub.

  - The next phase in the release process is the deployment of the service.
  - However, running an application in production implies that thousands and millions of customers might consume the product at the same time.
  - For this reason, it is **paramount to build for scale**.
  - It is impossible to manually manage thousands of containers, keeping these are up to date with the latest code changes, in a healthy state, and accessible.
  - As a result, a **container orchestrator framework** is necessary.

- A container orchestrator framework is capable to create, manage, configure thousands of containers on a set of distributed servers while preserving the connectivity and reachability of these containers.

  - In the past years, multiple tools emerged within the landscape to provide these capabilities, including **Docker Swarm**, **Apache Mesos**, **CoreOS Fleet**, and many more.
  - However, Kubernetes took the lead in defining the principles of how to run containerized workloads on a distributed amount of machines.

- Kubernetes is widely adopted in the industry today, with most organizations using it in production.
- Kubernetes currently is a graduated CNCF project, which highlights its maturity and reported success from end-user companies.
- This is because Kubernetes problem solves portability, scalability, resilience, service discovery, extensibility, and operational cost of containers.

### Portability

- Kubernetes is a highly portable tool.
  - This is due to its open-source nature and vendor agnosticism.
  - As such, Kubernetes can be hosted on any available infrastructure, including public, private, and hybrid cloud.

### Scalability

- Building for scale is a cornerstone of any modern infrastructure, enabling an application to scale based on the amount of incoming traffic.
  - Kubernetes has in-build resources, such as HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), to determine the required amount of replicas for a service.
  - Elasticity is a core feature that is highly automated within Kubernetes.

### Resilience

- Failure is expected on any platform. However, it is more important to be able to recover from failure fast and build a set of playbooks that minimizes the downtime of an application.
  - Kubernetes uses functionalities like ReplicaSet, readiness, and liveness probes to handle most of the container failures, which enables powerful self-healing capability.

### Service Discovery

- Service discovery encapsulates the ability to automatically identify and reach new services once these are available.
  - Kubernetes provide cluster level DNS (or Domain Name System), which simplifies the accessibility of workloads within the cluster.
  - Additionally, Kubernetes provides routing and load balancing of incoming traffic, ensuring that all requests are served without application overload.

### Extensibility

- Kubernetes is a highly extensible mechanism that uses the building-block principle.
  - It has a set of basic resources that can be easily adjusted.
  - Additionally, it provides a rich API interface, that can be extended to accommodate new resources or CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions).

### Operational Cost

- Operational cost refers to the efficiency of resource consumption within a Kubernetes cluster, such as CPU and memory.
  - Kubernetes has a powerful scheduling mechanism that places an application on the node with sufficient resources to ensure the successful execution of the service.
  - As a result, most of the available infrastructure resources are allocated on-demand.
  - Additionally, it is possible to automatically scale the size of the cluster based on the current incoming traffic.
  - This capability is provisioned by the cluster-autoscaler, which guarantees that the cluster size is directly proportional to the traffic that it needs to handle.

## Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes architecture, composed of control and data planes

- A Kubernetes cluster is composed of a collection of distributed physical or virtual servers.

  - These are called nodes.
  - Nodes are categorized into 2 main types: master and worker nodes.
  - The components installed on a node, determine the functionality of a node, and identifies it as a master or worker node.

- The suite of master nodes, represents the control plane, while the collection of worker nodes constructs the data plane.

## Control Plane

Control Plane components

The control plane consists of components that make global decisions about the cluster. These components are the:

- **kube-apiserver** - the nucleus of the cluster that exposes the Kubernetes API, and handles and triggers any operations within the cluster
- **kube-scheduler** - the mechanism that places the new workloads on a node with sufficient satisfactory resource requirements
- **kube-controller-manager** - the component that handles controller processes. It ensures that the desired configuration is propagated to resources
- **etcd** - the key-value store, used for backs-up and keeping manifests for the entire cluster

There are two additional components on the control plane, they are kubelet and k-proxy. These two are special and important as they are installed on all node. You can see the Data Plane below for more details.

## Data Plane

Data Plane components

The data plane consists of the compute used to host workloads. The components installed on a worker node are the:

- **kubelet** - the agent that runs on every node and notifies the **kube- apiserver** that this node is part of the cluster
- **kube-proxy** - a network proxy that ensures the reachability and accessibility of workloads places on this specific node

**Important Note:**

- The **kubelet** and **kube-proxy** components are installed on all the nodes in the cluster (master and worker nodes).
- These components keep the **kube-apiserver** up-to-date with a list of nodes in the cluster and manages the connectivity and reachability of the workloads.

### New terms

**CRD** - Custom Resource Definition provides the ability to extend Kubernetes API and create new resources
**Node** - a physical or virtual server
**Cluster** - a collection of distributed nodes that are used to manage and host workloads
**Master node** - a node from the Kubernetes control plane, that has installed components to make global, cluster-level decisions
**Worker node** - a node from the Kubernetes data plane, that has installed components to host workloads

## Quiz

1. The control plane makes the global decisions on the actions within a cluster. Which components are installed on a node to mark it as part of the control plane, but at the same time to ensure that this node is part of the Kubernetes cluster?

   - api-server
   - etcd
   - kubelet
   - kube-proxy
   - controller-manager
   - scheduler

2. The data plane is used to host workloads onto the cluster. Which components are installed on a node to mark it as part of the data plane in a Kubernetes cluster?

   - kube-proxy
   - kubelet
