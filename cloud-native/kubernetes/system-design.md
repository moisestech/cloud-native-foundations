# System Design

Glossary

Monolith
application design where all application tiers are managed as a single unit

Microservice:
application design where application tiers are managed as independent, smaller units

Docker and Kubernetes
Dockerfile:
set of instructions used to create a Docker image

Docker image:
a read-only template used to spin up a runnable instance of an application

Docker registry:
a central mechanism to store and distribute Docker images

CRD:
Custom Resource Definition provides the ability to extend Kubernetes API and create new resources

Node:
a physical or virtual server

Cluster:
a collection of distributed nodes that are used to manage and host workloads

Master node:
a node from the Kubernetes control plane, that has installed components to make global, cluster-level decisions

Worker node:
a node from the Kubernetes data plane, that has installed components to host workloads

Bootstrap:
the process of provisioning a Kubernetes cluster, by ensuring that each node has the necessary components to be fully operational

Kubeconfig:
a metadata file that grants a user access to a Kubernetes cluster

Pod:
smallest manageable uint within a cluster that provides the execution environment for an application

ReplicaSet:
a mechanism to ensure a number of pod replicas are up and running at all times

Deployment:
describe the desired state of the application to be deployed

Service:
an abstraction layer over a collection of pods running an application

Ingress:
a mechanism to manage the access from external users and workloads to the services within the cluster

Configmap:
a resource to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs.

Secret:
a resource to store confidential data in key-value pairs. These are base64 encoded.

Namespace:
a logical separation between multiple applications and associated resources.

Imperative configuration:
resource management technique, that operates and interacts directly with the live objects within the cluster.

Declarative configuration:
resource management technique, that operates and manages resources using YAML manifests stored locally.

Cloud-Computing Services
On-premise:
cloud-computing service, where a team owns the entire technology stack.

IaaS or Infrastructure as a Service:
cloud-computing service that offers the abstraction of networking, storage, server, and virtualization layers.

PaaS or Platform as a Service:
cloud-computing service, where the infrastructure components are managed fully by a 3rd party provider, and a team manages only the application and the data associated with it.

Cloud Foundry:
an open-source PaaS offering, that can be hosted on any available infrastructure

FaaS or Function as a Service:
event-driven cloud-computing service that requires only the application code to execute successfully.

Ci/CD
Continuous Integration:
a mechanism that produces the package of an application that can be deployed.

Continuous Delivery:
a mechanism to push the packaged application through multiple environments, including production.

Continuous Deployment:
a procedure that contains the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery of a product.

GitOps:
an operating model that refers to the Git repositories as the source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

Helm:
package manager tool used to template a suite of Kubernetes manifests.

Helm chart:
a collection of configuration, input, and templated YAML files used to deploy Kubernetes resources.
