## Continuous Deployment

## Summary

- SummaryThroughout the Microservice Fundamentals course, we walked through a realistic example of how to choose an architecture for an application, package it using Docker, and deployed it to a Kubernetes cluster using a CI/CD pipeline.We have started off with an overview of the cloud-native ecosystem and the tools it hosts. Then we've learned different application designs, such as monoliths and microservice, and implied trade-offs. We then moved to package an application using Docker and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster using imperative and declarative configurations. Then, we transitioned into Platform as a Service (or PaaS) solutions and explored Cloud.

- Foundry as an approach to deploy an application without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. And we finished this course, by practicing cloud-native tooling to construct a CI/CD pipeline. We deep-dived into GitHub Actions and ArgoCD and explored template configuration managers, such as Helm.Overall, in this course we have covered the following lessons:•Welcome•Architecture Considerations•Container Orchestration•Open Source PaaS Cloud Native CI/CD
