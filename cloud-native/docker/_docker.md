# Docker

- A tool that can package software into container that work reliably on any environment.
- Instead of virtualizing the hardware, containers only virtualize the OS (Operating System)
- All apps and containers are ran by a single kernel

---

## [What is a Container?](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## 3 Elements of a Docker

1. **Docker File**
   - It's like DNA, it is code that tells Docker how to build an image.
2. **Image**
   - A snapshot of your software with all of its dependencies down to its operating system level.
   - The image is immutable which can be used to spin up multiple containers which is the actual software running in the real world.
3. **Container**
   - Actual Software running in the real world.

## Docker for Application Packaging

| DOCKER COMPONENT     | PURPOSE                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docker File**      | Set of instructions to create a Docker Image             |
| **Docker Image**     | A read-only template that is used to spin-up a container |
| **Docker Container** | A runnable instance of the Docker image                  |
| **Docker Registry**  | A tool used to store and distribute Docker images        |

By default, Docker will create OCI (Open Container Initiative) compliant images. What is the reason for using OCI guidelines?

- To standardize the image formats
- To ensure that images can execute on OCI compliant runtimes

| DOCKER COMMAND                                                                       | OUTPUT                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Build a Docker image using `Dockerfile.staging file` in the `app/backend` folder** | `docker build \ -f Dockerfile.staging app/backend`      |
| **Create an interactive shell to a `busybox` container**                             | `docker run -it busybox`                                |
| **Tag the new image ID as the front-end application in `versionv4.5.2`**             | `docker tag f10f0a406345 \ pixelpotato/frontend:v4.5.2` |
| **Push the new front-end application to DockerHub**                                  | `docker push \ pixelpotato/frontend:v4.5.2`             |
| **Login into the DockerHub using valid credentials**                                 | `docker login`                                          |

## How docker works?

1. It packages apps into a single unit called an image.
2. When you run these images via docker, they are called containers.
3. A single container is an instance of an image.
4. You can run many containers based out of single image.
5. A common analogy is to imagine containers like shipping containers. The content of the container may vary, but because they are similarly shaped (containers), they can be handled the same way.
6. However, often, containers are related, and they may be sent to a single location.
7. In docker, the contents of a container come together to form a singular unit that represents an app, service or any piece of software.
8. A dockerized app contains all the services, programs and libraries you need along with the instruction on how to run the dockerized app and the environment.
9. An image is an immutable that is a snapshot of a container.
10. Imagines are constructed with build command and executed with a container with the run command.
11. Images are stored in the docker registry and used when needed.
12. Large images are composed of layers of other images.
13. The advantage of layers is that it can be transferred easily.

## Hands-On Open Source CI/CD Tools:

1. Install a Oracle Virtual box/VM-Ware on your local system.
2. Deploy a Linux(ubuntu) VM.
3. Install the putty client for SSH connection.
4. Install all the dependencies.
5. Install the tool like git, Jenkins, Chef, etc. Which ever you wanted to learn.
6. Repeat the same.
