- **Cloud-native** refers to the set of practices that empowers an organization to **build and manage applications at scale**.

- They can achieve this goal by using **private, hybrid, or public cloud providers**.

  - In addition to scale, an organization needs to be agile in integrating customer feedback and adapting to the surrounding technology ecosystem.

- **Containers** are closely associated with cloud-native terminology. Containers are used to run a single application with all required dependencies. The main characteristics of containers are easy to manage, deploy, and fast to recover. As such, often, a **micro-service-based architecture** is chosen in tandem with cloud-native tooling.
- **Micro-services** are used to manage and configure a collection of small, independent services that can be easily packaged and executed within a container.

- Overall, **Kubernetes** is a container orchestrator that is capable to problem-solve the integration of the following functionalities:

1. Runtime
2. Networking
3. Storage
4. Service Mesh
5. Logs and metrics
6. Tracing

- An engineering team can use cloud-native tooling to enable quick delivery of **value to customers** and **easily extend** to new features and technologies. These are the main reasons why an organization needs to adopt cloud-native technologies. However, when trialing cloud-native tooling, there are two main perspectives to address: business and technical stakeholders.

- From a **business perspective**, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:

1. **Agility** - perform strategic transformations
2. **Growth** - quickly iterate on customer feedback
3. **Service availability** - ensures the product is available to customers 24/7

- From a **technical perspective**, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:

1. **Automation** - release a service without human intervention
2. **Orchestration** - introduce a container orchestrator to manage thousands of services with minimal effort
3. **Observability** - ability to independently troubleshoot and debug each component
