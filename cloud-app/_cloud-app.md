- **Cloud-native** refers to the set of practices that empowers an organization to **build and manage applications at scale**.

- They can achieve this goal by using **private, hybrid, or public cloud providers**.

  - In addition to scale, an organization needs to be agile in integrating customer feedback and adapting to the surrounding technology ecosystem.

- **Containers** are associated with cloud-native terminology.
- Containers are small units of a bigger software which are isolated from each other which makes deploying them fast and resilient and they fit very well in a micro-service based architecture.
- Containers are used to run a single application with all required dependencies. The main characteristics of containers are easy to manage, deploy, and fast to recover.
- As such, often, a **micro-service-based architecture** is chosen in tandem with cloud-native tooling.
- **Micro-services** are used to manage and configure a collection of small, independent services that can be easily packaged and executed within a container.

Using multiple containers and managing them can be quite hectic so you can use am orchestrator that will help configure and deploy your containers to your cloud. There are many cloud orchestrators available some of them are.

1. Docker Swarm
2. Apache Mesos
3. Kubernetes

- Overall, **Kubernetes** is a container orchestrator that is capable to problem-solve the integration of the following functionalities:

1. Runtime
2. Networking
3. Storage
4. Service Mesh
5. Logs and metrics
6. Tracing

- An engineering team can use cloud-native tooling to enable quick delivery of **value to customers** and **easily extend** to new features and technologies. These are the main reasons why an organization needs to adopt cloud-native technologies. However, when trialing cloud-native tooling, there are two main perspectives to address: business and technical stakeholders.

- From a **business perspective**, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:

1. **Agility** - perform strategic transformations
2. **Growth** - quickly iterate on customer feedback
3. **Service availability** - ensures the product is available to customers 24/7

- From a **technical perspective**, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:

1. **Automation** - release a service without human intervention
2. **Orchestration** - introduce a container orchestrator to manage thousands of services with minimal effort
3. **Observability** - ability to independently troubleshoot and debug each component
